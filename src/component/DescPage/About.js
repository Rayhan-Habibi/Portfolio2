            When I was 10 years old, I filled my school exam paper with sketches of my redesigned app, 
            starting from Microsoft Office to sketching my own Linux distribution's user interface. 
            After several years of learning many things from scratch, I ended up building my own website with my own design.
            I was be able to make the website especially for <b>school</b>, <b>start-up</b>, and <b>your business.</b>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
            My main objective while building the website is 
            <br />
            <b>Accessible</b>, So your website will reach huge target audience.
            <br />
            <b>Peformance</b>, Worring about you costumer will run away because the website is slow-loaded? Worry not, Say goodbye to peformance issue.
            <br />
            <b>Featureful</b>, Do you need in-website todoList? or built-in chat app? I am the right solution for your needs.
            <br />
            <b>Aesthetic</b>, User Interface is mandatory to keep your audience enjoy able in the website.
